# Implementation Phases - Developer Portal

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology

This project follows a strict Test-Driven Development approach where tests are written before implementation:

### TDD Cycle
1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the desired functionality
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests green

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, components, and workflows in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between services and APIs
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user journeys and workflows
- **Contract Tests**: Test API specifications and OpenAPI contracts
- **Infrastructure Tests**: Test CDK stacks and infrastructure components

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints and workflows
- **E2E Tests**: All critical user journeys
- **Contract Tests**: All OpenAPI specifications
